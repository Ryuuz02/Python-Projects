# Python-Projects

Hello, This is the master folder for all my Python projects I have worked in. They are somewhat sorted into groups, but some tend to be a bit on the vague side.

As I have just moved all my files from one folder to another, I'm sure there are dependency Errors, which I will try to fix soon.

Any of my folders marked with tutorial are likely taken from an online tutorial, will try to make mark of the website.
